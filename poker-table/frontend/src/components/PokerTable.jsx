/**
 * PokerTable — 4 player seats pinned to the corners of whatever space this
 * component is given, with the felt table filling the leftover space between
 * them (computed in JS, not CSS flexible tracks — see the long comment below
 * for why).
 *
 * cornerScale is solved from the corners' full natural size (cards +
 * nameplate together) competing against the felt's preferred size — the same
 * floor→natural-size blend as before. How big the felt itself prefers to be
 * is controlled by `variant`: in "dealer" mode it's the previous fixed
 * reference size (MIN_FELT_HEIGHT/WIDTH); in "spectator" mode there's no
 * ceiling on it at all — it fills all the leftover space (capped only by
 * TARGET_ASPECT, so it stays a recognizable oval rather than a flat
 * stretched ellipse), since spectator view typically has much more room to
 * give it. Bigger player cards do cost a little cornerScale when space is
 * tight (a real, modest trade-off — see the comment above solveCornerScale).
 *
 * Note on why this isn't done with CSS Grid `1fr` / flexbox `flex-grow`:
 * those need a definite container height to distribute from. This component
 * is meant to fill whatever bounded space its parent already gives it
 * (SpectatorView's content area, or DealerView's left column) — which IS
 * definite (both views constrain it via a min-h-0 flex chain) — so plain
 * measurement + arithmetic here is enough; no uniform-scale-a-fixed-canvas
 * wrapper (like the old ScaleToFit) is needed anymore.

 * Props: gameState (session object), variant ("dealer" | "spectator")
